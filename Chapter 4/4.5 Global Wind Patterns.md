# 4.5 Global Wind Patterns

- Earth's atmosphere is held by gravity
- as Earth rotates, air circulates
- heating and cooling changes of density of air as it moves due to convection

**Coriolis effect**: Along with heat, rotation of earth deflects the wind as well

- exchange of heat & Coriolis effect leads to patterns that are generally regular
- ecosystems result from these exchanges of heat and rotation
