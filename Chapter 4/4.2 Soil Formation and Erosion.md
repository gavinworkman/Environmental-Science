# 4.2 Soil Formation and Erosion
Soil is formed when parent material is weathered, transported, and deposited.

**Parent material** – original rocks that were broken down to form the basis of the soil.

**Weathering** – mechanical breakdown of rock

Factors in soil formation:
- type of parent material
- climate  (moisture)
- topography (slope of land affects erosion)
- Biological factors
- Time

Factors impacting soil erosion:
- Water
- Wind
- Gravity
- Human factors

Human impacts:
- deforestation (roots prevent erosion)
- overgrazing – cattle overeating can cause erosion in top layer of soil
- Pesticides and ferrtilizer – change chemistry and kill microorganisms
- tillage – turning and breaking up soil keeps top layer from accumulating

**Solutions**:
Sheet erosion (surface layer removed by water) -> maintain plant cover
Rill erosion (small channels of water flow) -> strip cropping or contour plowering
Fully Erosion (wider cuts from expanded rill erosion) -> divert water away from rills and gullies
