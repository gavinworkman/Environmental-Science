- Time is on the X-axis – goes from birth to the maximum life span
- Y axis is the percentage of organisms surviving – logarithmic scale 
- **Type I** – Late loss – most population survives from birth to death (K strategist)
- **Type II** – Constant loss – death rate constant from birth to death
- **Type III** – Early loss – large percent of population dies early in life (r strategist)
