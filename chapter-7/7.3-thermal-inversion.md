# 7.3 Thermal Inversion

**Under normal conditions**: as altitude increases, temperature decreases

**During inversion**:

* warmer layer of air on top of cool surface air
* warm air traps cool, dense air

**Geography encourages inversion layers**:

* valleys
* nearby mountain ranges
* coastal or prevailing winds

**Pollution intensified by**:

* large cities
* high industrialization
* lots of vehicles
