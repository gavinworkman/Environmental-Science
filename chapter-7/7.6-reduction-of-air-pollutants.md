# 7.6 Reduction of Air Pollutants

**Clean air act**: Regulates emission of air pollutants that affect human health

**Auto emissions**:

* Eliminate lead in gas
* cleaner technologies in transportation

**Acid rain**:

* Determine levels of how much pollution is permissable by industries
* Promote technilogies for reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides

**Alternative fuels**:

* natural gas
* propoane
* ethanol
* electricity
* biofuels

**Conservation actions**:

* energy efficientcy
* water based rather than solvent based \(less VOCs\)
* transporation planning
* higher fuel standards
* indiviudal and community actions \(recycling, no idle zones\)

**Vapor recovery nozzle**:

* captures vapors escaping fuel tank while fuelign car
* EPA required these since 2006
* EPA stopped requiring this, but allowed states to force them 2013

**Catalytic converter**:

* reduce toxicity of emissions
* uses chemical reactions to change pollutants into harmless gases

**Scrubbers** remove pollutant from exhaust streams:

* use spray, mist to capture and change pollutants
* Water can sometimes be this liquid
* Dry scrubbers use dry particles to capture or change pollutants
* added weight can make pollutants fall to the bottom

**Electrostatic precipitators** use electircal charge to reduce pollutants:

* It adds a charge to pollutants
* As soot moves out, the particles will stick to a metal plate of a given charge

All technologies are effective, but create waste products.
