# 7.7 Acid Rain

* Natural rain has a pH of 5.6 
* acid rain has pH or 4.3
* Acidity is expressed using pH scale
* NOx reacts with water resulting in nitric acid
* SO2 reactions with water resulting in sulfuric acid
* Nitric acid and sulfuric acid can be in form of dry deposits or rain/snow
* SOx and NOx are released
* SOx and NOx react with water adn are carried by winds
* Acid rain and dry particles are deposited
* Ecosystems are negatively impacted because of this

Impact on forests and soils:

* Acid rain promots aluminum ions to leach from soils
* tree roots cannot take up calcium when aluminum ions are present
* reduced photosynthetic activity
