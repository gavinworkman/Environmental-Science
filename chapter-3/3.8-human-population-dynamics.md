# 3.8 Human Population Dynamics

**Factors that slow population growth**:

* Low birth rates
* High death rates
* High education of women
* Low Nutrition
* High Age of marriage
* Even human populations experience carrying capatcity
* Per Thomas Malthus, all populations face carrying capactiy
* We're conrtolled by density Independent and density depenent factors
  1. Density Independent:
     1. Storms
     2. Fires
     3. Heat Waves
     4. Drought
  2. Density Dependent:
     1. Disease transmission
     2. Territory size
     3. Food availibility
     4. Access to clean air and water

**Doubling time**: Amount of time for population to double at a constant growth rate

**Rule of 70**: 70/r â€“ doubling time, where r is the growth rate as a percentage \(not a decimal\)
