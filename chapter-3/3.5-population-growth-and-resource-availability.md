# 3.5 Population Growth and Resource Availability

**Environmental resistance**: Factors that limit growth

**Density Dependent** resistance factors:

* tend to be biotic
* have strong influence when organisms per unit area reach certain level
* competition for resources
* predation
* parasitism/disease

**Density independent** resistance factors:

* tend to be abiotic
* have effect on all populations, regardless of size or density
* i.e. natural disasters, sever weather, drought
