# 1.4 The Carbon Cycle

Type: Ecosystems

Carbon cycle – movement of molecules that contain carbon between sources and sinks

Biogeochemical cycle – cycles in both living and non-living ways (involves biotic and abiotic processes)

- **Atmosphere** – in gaseous form and it is moved to the land
- **Photosynthesis** – CO2 → glucose
- **Respiration** – CO2 is a product
- **Decomposition** – carbon can be returned to air or even into the ground
- The deep ocean and deep underground are carbon reservoirs
- **Fossil carbon** – fossilized remains of plants and animals
- Extraction and burning of fossil carbon releases ancient carbon into the atmosphere

**Fast carbon cycling:** 

- Moving of carbon through biosphere
- driven by producers
- main processes are photosynthesis and respiration
- Primary carbon reservoir is the atmosphere

**Decomposition**: Carbon is returned to atmosphere or it is returned to soil or water by decomposer organisms. 

**Sedimentation or burial**: Much longer sequestration of carbon (essentially removed from cycle)

Uplift and weathering of limestone (slow process) or the extraction and combustion of fossil fuels (fast process) can return carbon from long term reservoirs to the cycle.
