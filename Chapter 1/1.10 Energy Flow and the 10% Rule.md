# 1.10 Energy Flow and the 10% Rule

Type: Ecosystems

**a) Human requires 200kcal/day. How much kcal needed in a year?**

2000kcal/day*365days/1year=730,000kcal

**b) One serving of chicken has 120kcal and a mass of 113g. How many servings of chicken are needed by a human in 1 year?**

730,000kcal/year*1/120kcal=6083 servings

**c) A chicken typically weighs 3kg. How many chicken would be consumed in one year?**

6083servings/year*113g/serving*1chicken/3kg*1kg/1000g=229 chickens

**d) A ear of corn requires 60kcal of energy. How many years are needed to provide all necessary kcal for an year?**

730kcal/year*1ear/60kcal=12,166ears

**e) How much corn is required to feed all chickens eaten by a human (chicken needs 150g of corn per day)?**

229chickens*150g/chicken/day*365days/year=12,537,750g 

**f) How many people could be fed if the corn was directly given to humans if an ear of corn weighs 65g?**

12,537,750g*1year/65g*1person/12,166= 15.8 people
