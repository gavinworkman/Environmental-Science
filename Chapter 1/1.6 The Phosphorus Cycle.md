- No atmospheric phase
- It is a limiting factor in ecosystems
- Producers need phosphorus to grow

1. Rocks: major reservoid
2. Uplift and whether takes phosphorus to soil
3. That can be dissolved into stream, or to go terrestrial food webs
4. Then it will go to the water through runoff (runoff of feces)
5. Then it will enter the marine food webs â€“ can be dissolved or become a sediment (and then uplift back to the start)
