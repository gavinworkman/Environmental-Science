# 1.1 Introduction to Ecosystems

Type: Ecosystems

**Ecosystem** - Community of living organisms  in conjunction with non living and the non-living organisms

**[[Biotic]]** (living):

- Producers
- Herbivores
- Carnivores
- Detritivores
- Soil

**[[Abiotic]]** (non-living):

- Soil
- Temperature
- precipitation
- Moisture

**Predator prey relationships:**

- Predators hunt and kill prey
- Biotic interactions
- Prey is a food resource to the predators

**Steps to understand graph**

1. What is the title of a graph
2. What is the X axis? The Y axis?
3. Describe trends and observations over time.
4. What other factors might cause relationships between data (common AP FRQ)

**[[Symbiosis]]** – close long term interaction between two species in an ecosystem (two species that are living together)

**Mutualism**: Beneficial for both species – benefit both of their chances of survival and reproduction. Be able to identify benefits, resources gained, and abiotic or biotic.

**Commensalism**: One species benefits, other species unaffected – these are long term. Scavengers are often an example of commensalism.

**Parasitism**: One organisms lives **on** or **inside of** another. The host is getting lived on, and the parasite is getting the benefits. The parasite rarely kills the host as that results in its death.

**Competition**: Individuals from different species (or the same one) that struggle to obtain a **limiting resource**.

**Limiting resource**: biotic or abiotic resource that limits population size or growth.

**Interspecific competition** – competition between different species. This can be biotic or abiotic.

**Resource partitioning**: When a limiting resource is used in different ways, places, or at different times to reduce competition. Competition is bad for all species involved.

**Intraspecific Competition**: Competition between one species. Here, the fittest individual wins. This makes the species more strong and adapted to environment.
