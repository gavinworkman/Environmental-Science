# 1.11 Food Chains and Food Webs

Type: Ecosystems

In a biome, you can have many food chains – more productive and biodiverse biomes have more food chains.

Several food chains make up a food web.

**Food Chain**

Susceptible to stress ([[human impact]]):
- habitat loss
- invasive species
- pollution
- human population
- overharvesting

**Food Web**

They are less susceptible to stress as they are more complex.

Food webs without an apex predator will increase the population of what they consume, and that can destroy an ecosystem (vegetation).

**Trophic cascade**: The result if the apex predator is removed (what happened in Yellowstone after wolves were removed)

Overfishing and introducing native species can harm an aquatic ecosystem. Additionally, chemicals can move their way through the food chain and all the way up to humans.

**Biomagnification and bioaccumulation:**

Biomagnification → magnification of contaminants through tropic levels

Bioaccumulation → accumulation of contaminants in an organism (fat solubility)
