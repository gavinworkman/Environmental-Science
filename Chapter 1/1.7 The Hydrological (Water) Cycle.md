- Essential to life on earth
- Processes driven by the sun
- Oceans are the primary reservoirs or water
- Ice caps and groundwater are smaller reservoirs

1. Water/solid → Water vapor: Evaporation or evapotranspiration or sublimation (solid to water vapor)
2. Precipitation: Water vapor → water. It collects on the ground and is returned to reservoirs via runoff.
3. Water can then penetrate into the ground via infiltration and percolation.
