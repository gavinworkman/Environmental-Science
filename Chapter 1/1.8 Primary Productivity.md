# 1.8 Primary Productivity

Type: Ecosystems

Source of energy is the sun â€“ we can convert this to chemical energy via photosynthesis (glucose). 

Glucose is then used in respiration.

**Gross primary productivity (GPP)**: photosynthesis from producers

**Respiration (R)**: Cellular respiration of producers

**Net primary productivity (NPP)**: GPP - R

**Secondary productivity**: What eats the surplus from the primary productivity

**Biomes and productivity:**

Moisture and higher temperatures result in higher productivity

How ecosystems vary by NPP

Agriculture and clear cutting will reduce the primary productivity of an area.

Primary productivity also changes throughout the year (in different seasons)
