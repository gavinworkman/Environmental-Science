# 2.4 Ecological Tolerance

Type: Biodiversity

**Ecological tolerance**: Range of conditions like temperature, salinity, flow rate, and sunlight that an organism can endure before injury or death.

Applies to both individuals and species â€“ they have a set of abiotic conditions they have adapted to

**Example of a visual**:

Here, the X-axis is an abiotic condition (i.e. temperature), and the y-axis is number of individuals

- Changes in abiotic conditions can cause stress to an organisms
- This bring changes in fitness and cause death (range of intolerance)
- More genetic diversity = better response to stress
- Even if an organism doesn't die, it can be unable to reproduce
- Different species in a habitat will define their niche based on their range of tolerance
