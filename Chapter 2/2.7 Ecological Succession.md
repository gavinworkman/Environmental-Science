# 2.7 Ecological Succession

Type: Biodiversity

**Succession**: Gradual process describing change in structure of a community over time – one community succeeds or replaces another. It is characterized by changes in the predominant plant community.

**Primary succession:**

- Begins in lifeless area (bare rock and no soil)
- Lichen will colonize the area, break down rock, and form soil. Then herbaceous and then woody plants will move in.
- Process
    1. Bare rock
    2. Greasses
    3. Shrubs
    4. Shade intolerant trees
    5. Shade tolerant trees

**Secondary succession:**

- This happens after disturbance
- You will return to grasses, shrubs, or shade intolerant trees
- Do **not** return to bare rock

**Keystone species**: Species whose activities have a significant role in community structure. Removing this down will trigger a trophic cascade.

**Ecosystem Engineer**: Organisms that create, change, or destroy a habitat (like beavers)

**Mutualists**: Two species that interact for benefit of both

**Indicator species**: One species being dominant or missing indicates that a negative or positive characteristic on the environment (i.e. ozone pollution)

**Pioneer species**: they are able to outcompete established vegetation that survives the disturbance.

- Broad ecological tolerance
- They are adaptable – can pass on beneficial traits quickly
- They begin to alter conditions that will make it more favorable for new species

Ecosystems that are in the final stage of succession have more biomass, greater productivity, and greater species richness than disturbed ecosystems.
