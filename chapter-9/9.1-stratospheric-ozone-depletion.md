# 9.1 Stratospheric Ozone Depletion

**Troposphric ozone**:

* from photochemical smog; harmful
* greenhouse gas

**Stratospheric ozone**:

* naturally occuring
* protects earth from radiation

UV-C is far worse than UV-B and UV-A

**Antartic spring**: 1. Antartic winders create stratospheric clouds full of ice crystals 2. These crystals melt in beggining of spring 3. Chemical reactions convert less reactive chlorine to more reactive form 4. Chlorine degrades ozone to oxygen

Ozone protects earth from UV radiation.

**CFCs**:

* refrigerant/coolant
* propellant
* Some types of plastics

**CFCs and ozone**:

* Radiation breaks off chlorine from CFC
* Chlorine will then break down O3 and can do so multiple times

Free chlorine catalyzes conversion of O3 to O2

**Ozone depletion**: 1. Thining of ozone layers at poles 2. Disruption of terrestroial photosynthesis 3. Disruption of photosynthesis by phytoplankton 4. Disruption of food chains/webs 5. Impacts populations of some organissms like amphibians 6. Impacts human health: skin cancer, cataracts
