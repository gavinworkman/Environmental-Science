# 9.4 Increases in Greenhouse Gases

Human activities have increased the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere.

Increases in GHGs in atmosphere has led to increases in temperature.

Consequences:

* **Sea level rise**
  * Land ice – continental sheets, ice sheets will melt adding more volume of water to ocean
  * Thermal expansion of ocean – water heats up as it expands
  * The ocean will make its way on the shoreline
* Disease vectors expand range
  * As globe heats up range for mosquitoes will inrcrease
  * they will move from tropics to include other areas
* Populations
  * habitat destruction
  * loss of food source
  * timing of food source availibility changes
  * new tempratures beyond range of tolerance
  * new salinity beyond range of tolerance
  * stronger storms
  * higher liklihood of fire
  * impacted group behaviors: migration, hibernation

Climate change especially harms marginalized populations.
