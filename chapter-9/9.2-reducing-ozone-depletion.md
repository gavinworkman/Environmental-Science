# 9.2 Reducing Ozone Depletion

**Montreal protocol**: International treaty to phase out CFCs and their manufacturing

* scientific research was acted upon in a global manner
* the ozone layer is coming back to its state before CFCs
* it will still take some time

To solve, this, we used HFCs â€“ they don't have chlorine atoms.

HFCs are a robust greenhouse gas.
