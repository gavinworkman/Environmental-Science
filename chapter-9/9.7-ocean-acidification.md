# 9.7 Ocean Acidification

**Ocean acidification**:

* Decrease of pH in the ocean
* It feel by 0.1 since the industrial revolution
* Due to increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere
* Oceans absorb much of the CO2 in the atmosphere
* Human activities leading to more CO2 also cause acidification
* CO2 + Water = Carbonic Acid
* Carbonic acid lowers pH of water
* Consequences:
  * Bicarbonate ions are formed, and marine organisms cannot extract carbonate from bicarbonate ions
  * Harder to build shells and exoskeletons
  * Existing shells can be dissolved
  * Coral reefs need carbonate ions to form skeletons â€“ acidification harms reefs
