# 9.6 Ocean Warming

**Ocean warming**:

* global increase in ocean water temperatures
* ocean warming isnt uniform across teh globe – some areas warm more quickly others
* caused by increased GHGs in atmosphere
* can lead to:
  * melting ice sheets
  * ocean water expansion
  * 1/3 of sea level rise is due to thermal expansion
* Loss of habitat:
  * reduction in ice impacts hunting and rfeeding patterns
  * higher water temperatures impact predator/prey interactions
  * Alter coastlines
  * Push communities out of photic zones
  * Impact primary productivity
* Metabolic changes: 
  * pushed to biological limts
  * reduces biodiversity
  * move out of range of tolerance
* Reproductive changes – organisms under thermal stress cant reproduce well
* Coral bleaching
  * Corals have algae living in bodies
  * when corals are stress they expel the algae
  * this is bleaching
  * coral colonies are foundations of highly biodiverse ecosystems
  * loss of coral colonies disrupt tropic structure of ecosystem
