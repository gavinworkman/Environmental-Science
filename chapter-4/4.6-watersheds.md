Rain will go from the highest point to the lowest point or it will percolate through the soil to join the groundwater

**Specific watershed**:

* area
* vegeteation
* type of soil that likely supports the vegetation
* slope of watershed

Human impacts:

* logging 1
* residential areas \(polluted water goes into water\)
* industrial 
* city \(polluted water running off\)
* cropland \(pestucudes\)
* dam \(block flow of sediment\)
