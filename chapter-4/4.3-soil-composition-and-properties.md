# 4.3 Soil Composition and Properties

Soil particles are made of three groups: sand, silt, clay

Sand – more water can pass through \(larger particle size\) Clay – water cannot pass through \(smaller particle size\)

**Using the soil triangle:** ![Screen Shot 2021-05-29 at 9.39.57 PM.png](https://github.com/pranavnt/APES/tree/fe3c4f5752990f03cbc4406e08c1972c97929b12/Chapter%204/assets/Screen%20Shot%202021-05-29%20at%209.39.57%20PM.png)

**Chemical tests**:

* pH \(to get acidity
* nitrogen
* phosphorus
* pottassium

**Physical tests:**

* soil composition
  * this will tell us the amount of percolation and infiltration that will happen 
* use soil triangle to classify sand

**Biological tests**:

* tests for organisms in the soil
* earthworms
