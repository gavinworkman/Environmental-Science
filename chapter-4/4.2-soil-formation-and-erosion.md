# 4.2 Soil Formation and Erosion

Soil is formed when parent material is weathered, transported, and deposited.

**Parent material** – original rocks that were broken down to form the basis of the soil.

**Weathering** – mechanical breakdown of rock

Factors in soil formation:

* type of parent material
* climate  \(moisture\)
* topography \(slope of land affects erosion\)
* Biological factors
* Time

Factors impacting soil erosion:

* Water
* Wind
* Gravity
* Human factors

Human impacts:

* deforestation \(roots prevent erosion\)
* overgrazing – cattle overeating can cause erosion in top layer of soil
* Pesticides and ferrtilizer – change chemistry and kill microorganisms
* tillage – turning and breaking up soil keeps top layer from accumulating

**Solutions**: Sheet erosion \(surface layer removed by water\) -&gt; maintain plant cover Rill erosion \(small channels of water flow\) -&gt; strip cropping or contour plowering Fully Erosion \(wider cuts from expanded rill erosion\) -&gt; divert water away from rills and gullies
