# 5.8 Impacts of Overfishing

**Commercial fishing**:

* long line
  * Very long line with evenly spaced hooks
  * Up to 20 miles long 
  * imapcts nontarget species \(including birds trying to eat fish on hooks\)
* drift net/gill net
  * long net set at varying depths
  * catches fish that swim there in their gills
  * very efficient
  * can kill nontarget species
* purse seine    
  * putting a massive net into teh ocean
  * surround a school of fish with the net
  * pull the fish up
  * efficient, but kill nontarget species
* trawling
  * Dragging a net on the bottom of the ocean
  * destructive to entire coastal floor ecosystem
* sonar
  * used to detect schools of fish
  * it interferes with navigation systems of whales

**Bycatch**: nontarget species that are caught

Making fishing more sustainable

* Maximum sustainable yield: maximum amount of fish that can be caught each year for it to be sustainable
* limit age/size of fish caught
* modify techniques to reduce bycatch
* laws/treaties that protect critical species

**Modified techniques**: Force turtles out of nets through adding metal bars
