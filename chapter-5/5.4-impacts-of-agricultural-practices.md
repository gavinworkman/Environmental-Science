# 5.4 Impacts of Agricultural Practices

**Arable land**: land where crops can be grown

**Tilling**: Preparing soil to plant soil \(rotating soil\)

**Bare soil**: soil erosion -&gt; evaporation, eutrophication, need for fertilizer **Turned soil** -&gt; Harms natural structure, sequestered carbon released

Mechanized farming: FFs are used

**Slash and burn**:

* typically used in topical rainforests \(low nutrient soils\)
* subsistence farmers
* unsustainable â€“ ash provided by ash quickly used
* Used primarily in LDCs and developing countries

Haber-Bosch Process: 3H2 + N2 -&gt; 2NH3 \(this is usable by plants\)

**Synthetic fertilizer**:

* Pros
  * easy to transport and used
  * timed release
  * easy to transport and use
* Cons
  * eutrophication
  * overused
  * does nothing to improve soil structure

**Natural Fertilizer**:

* Pros:
  * Can be worked into soil
  * improves soil structure
* Cons 
  * must be gathered
  * nutrient levels unknown
  * harder to use
