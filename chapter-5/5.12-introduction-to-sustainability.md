# 5.12 Introduction to Sustainability

**Sustainability**: ability to use and maintain a resource indefintely or for future generations \(input = output\)

**Environmental indicators**: **Biodiversity** -&gt; Healthier ecosystems are resistant to disturbances \(preserve nature\) **Food production** -&gt; poor practices lead to soil degradation and water pollution \(sustainable food practices\) **Global surface temperatures and CO2 concentrations** -&gt; excessive CO2 incresaes global temperatures creating climate change \(decrease energy use\) **Human population** -&gt; exponential population growth stresses the planet \(demographic transition\) **Resource depletion** -&gt; will this resource be available in the future \(reducte, reuse, recycle\)

**Sustainable yield**: Amount of renewable resource that can be taken without reducing the available supply \(50% of carrying capacity\)

**How can we harvest sustainable yields?** **Research and planning** -&gt; reproductive abilities of a resources **Setting quotas** -&gt; setting limits **Requiring permits** -&gt; manages harvesters **Focus on long term** -&gt; sustainability **Reforest** -&gt; replace trees that were harvested
