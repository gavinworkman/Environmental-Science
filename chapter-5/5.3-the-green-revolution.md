# 5.3 The Green Revolution

**Green revolution**: large scale, productive agricultural operations

* mechanized
  * No drawbacks of living labor
  * specialized and updated
  * easy to use
  * very efficient – higher profits
  * They are FF powered \(includes extraction and combustion\)
* monocultures
  * Easy to plant/maintain
  * loss of habitat and biodiversity
  * loss of ancestral varieties
  * increased possibilities of catastrophic event
* use artificial fertilizer and pesticides
  * release nutrients over time
  * mass produced
  * no objectional spill
  * easily dissolve in runoff
  * lead to eutrophication
  * disrupts nitrogen cycle
  * artificial pesticides kill nontarget species and lead to the pesticide treadmill
* Extensive irrigation used
  * customized application
  * maximized yield
  * depletion of freshwater

**Artificial selection**: human directed evolution selects for traits beneficial to humans

**Creation of GMOs**: Human dirceted evolution that selects for traits beneficial to humans that take advantage of the genetic material of normally incompatible species – creates new traits in host speciies

**Benefits**:

* creates crops that can grow on land once unusable for agriculture \(drought/heat resistant, salt tolerant\)
* herbicide resistent – roundup ready corn
* crops can produce their own insecticide – less artificial insecticides used

**Drawbacks**:

* Fertilizer will be needed in arid lands
* Weeds can become herbicide resistant
* May kill nontarget species
* Lead to insecticide resistant pests
* Moral/ethical/economic issues with patented genetic modification
