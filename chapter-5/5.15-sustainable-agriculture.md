# 5.15 Sustainable Agriculture

**Countour plowing**:

* This leaves soil intact
* Leaving a hill/mountain in place, rather than flattening it

**Windbreaks**:

* reduce wind erosion 
* less soil blown away

**Strip cropping**

* Harvesting one crop at a different time 
* leaves one crop holding soil in place at all times

**Terracing**:

* plowing steps in a hill
* reduces velocity of water going downhill
* reduces erosion

**No till agriculture**:

* leaves soil in place
* does not loosen soil to resist erosion

**Perennial Crops**:

* Crop roots hold soil together year round
* no need to replant

**Crop rotation**:

* may replanish nutrients naturally
* legumes add nitrogen to soil

**Green manure**:

* add bulk & NPK to soil
* this slowly decomposes

**Limestone**:

* Adds calcium to soil
* increases pH of soil, making it more alkaline

**Overgrazing**: Extensive grazing that causes plant damage

**Rotational grazing**: Cycling of livestock around a particular part of their pasture as to note overgraze an area.
