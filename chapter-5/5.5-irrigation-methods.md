# 5.5 Irrigation Methods

**Flood irrigation**:

* Take a lake/spring/river
* divert it to field
* build a wall to retain the water
* Pros:
  * easy
  * inexpensive
  * no mechanization
* Cons:
  * requires water nearby
  * not for all plant types
  * levees needed
  * 20% of water lost to evaporation
  * waterlogging/salization

**Furrow irrigation**:

* build trenches
* divert water so it goes into the trenches and let it seep into the soil
* Pros:    
  * low investment
  * high sediment water can be used
  * allows for some precision of appliaction
* Cons:
  * Not efficient on sandy soil \(will infiltrate\)
  * difficult to apply in small amounts
  * 33% of water lost to evaporation

**Spray irrigation**:

* pumping groundwater through nozzles into fields
* involve mechanization – used in developed world
* Pros:
  * Precision appliaction
  * Supplements can be introuced into water
  * efficient – 25% of less lost to evaporation
  * can be programmed to run at certain times
* Cons:
  * larger follow up cost
  * FFs power it
  * nozzles can clog

**Drip irrigation**:

* Pipes that have micropores that go below ground
* water goes straight to roots
* Pros:
  * very efficient \(only 5% lost to evaporation\)
  * reduces nutrient leaching
  * no land grading needed.
  * good for porous, sandy soil
* Cons:
  * Very expensive, clogs easily
  * requires mechanization
  * placement makes any other processes difficult

**Waterlogging**:

* plants need air pockets near roots to perform respiration
* overwatering clogs these pockets
* this kills plants

**Salinization**:

* Salt will buildup on top of soil
* Freshwater still has a bit of salt
* overtime soil will build up after evaporation
* very costly to remediate

**Aquifer use and overuse**:

* Aquifers are used for a source of groundwater
* recharged from infiltrated groundwater
* they are overused – water taken faster than recharged
* Saltwater intrusion is a problem in coastal aquifers
