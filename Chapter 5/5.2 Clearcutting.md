# 5.2 Clearcutting

**Clearcutting**: when you cut down all the trees in a forest

- forests play critical role in ecosystems and provide important and expensive ecosystem services
- Trees are carbon sink
- Important in water cycle – prevent erosion and evapotranspiration

**Timber**: trees right after they are cut down
**Lumber**: When you shape timber in any way

**Impact of clearcutting on terrestrial environments:**
- Reduction in soil carbon
- Topsoil will erode
- Decreased. albedo – ground is warmer, less moisture in the ground
- clearcutting on a slope can cause mudslides
