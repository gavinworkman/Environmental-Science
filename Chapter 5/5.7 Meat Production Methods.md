# 5.7 Meat Production Methods
Main methods of meat production: CAFOs/feedlots and free range grazing

- overconsumption is a problem in the **developed world**
- overconsumption occurs after demographic transition
- major land investment
- large amounts of animal waste produced 
	- reduce DO levels
	- can end up in drinking water
- Corn -> people vs. Corn -> livestock -> people
- Antibiotic and growth hormone use
- Soil compaction
- Reducing consumption:
	- reducing CO2, methane, N2O emissions
	- reduce use of antibiotics
	- conserve water 
	- improve topsoil

**CAFOs**: lot of animals in a small space for meat production

- Pros
	- they are large but very efficient
	- the whole purpose is to meet need for meat
	- keeps consumer costs down
- Cons
	- they are crowded 
	- create a ton of waste
	- increased nutrients in nearby waterways

**Free range grazing**:
- Pros
	- raised in natural environment
	- no need for antibiotics
- Cons:
	- less cattle per land area
	- Costs more
	- no use of growth horrmone
	
**Overgrazing**:
- tragedy of the commons
- everyone overgrazes their cattle acting in self interest
