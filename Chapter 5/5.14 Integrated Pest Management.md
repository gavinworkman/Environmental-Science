# 5.14 Integrated Pest Management
**IPM**: Combination of methods used to reduce and eliminate pest species. It includes biological, physical, and chemical controls. 

Goal is to reduce the amount of chemical pesticides used to reduce the pesticide treatmill and poisoning of non-target species and humans.

**Biological controls**: Introduction of natural predactors
- farm cat/dog
- parasitic wasps
- praying mantis
- green lacewings
- bacteria
- fungi
**Physical controls**: Barriers that protect crops
- traps
- tilling 
- screens
- weed blocker
- fences
**Chemical controls**: Pesticides, used as last resort
- Glyphosate
- Atrazine
- DDT

**Crop rotation**: Switch which crops are used â€“ replacing corn with soy
**Intercropping**: planting multiple crops on one field

**Harm of chemical pesticides**:
- Harms non-targeted wildlife (including insect predators)
- Water supplies (water pollution)
- Human health 

**Benefits**:
- decreases chemical pesticides used
- saves money
- sustainable
- targeted
- minimizes loss of polinators
- minimizes health risk
- minimizes pesticide resistance

**Drawbacks**:
- complex
- slow
- expensive
