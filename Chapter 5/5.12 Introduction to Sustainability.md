# 5.12 Introduction to Sustainability
**Sustainability**: ability to use and maintain a resource indefintely or for future generations (input = output)

**Environmental indicators**:
**Biodiversity** -> Healthier ecosystems are resistant to disturbances (preserve nature)
**Food production** -> poor practices lead to soil degradation and water pollution (sustainable food practices)
**Global surface temperatures and CO2 concentrations** -> excessive CO2 incresaes global temperatures creating climate change (decrease energy use)
**Human population** -> exponential population growth stresses the planet (demographic transition)
**Resource depletion** -> will this resource be available in the future (reducte, reuse, recycle)

**Sustainable yield**: Amount of renewable resource that can be taken without reducing the available supply (50% of carrying capacity)

**How can we harvest sustainable yields?**
**Research and planning** -> reproductive abilities of a resources
**Setting quotas** -> setting limits
**Requiring permits** -> manages harvesters
**Focus on long term** -> sustainability
**Reforest** -> replace trees that were harvested
