# 5.1 Tragedy of the Commons
**Tragedy of the Commons**: Individuals use shared resources in self intereste rather than keeping with common good, depleting the resource.

**Commons**: Anything that can be used publicly – regulated by no one (grazing lang, atmosphere)

**Solution**:
- hunting/fishing permits
- land use permits
- country quotes (pollution, fish harvest, etc.)
- selective cutting of trees

**Replenish**:
- replant trees
- throw back fish that are gravid
- rotate grasslands used for grazing

**Ensure compliance**:
- treaties
- laws
- oversight of these laws – fines/incentives

Another solution: Privatize commons cause this incentivizes caring for the commons.
