# 5.6 Pest Control Methods

**Pesticide treadmill**:
- Weed will be there with a genetic variety
- herbicide sprayed
- some random mutation will survive
- future generations will be resistant
- you will need to either you more of that herbicide or a new type of pesticide

**Why even use pesticides?**
- reduce impact of pests on crops
- maximizes yield
- farmers can only sell undamaged crops

**GMOs**:
- like artifical selection 
- we insert a gene from one organism to another organism
- can kill nontarget species
- monocultures are susceptible to catastrophe
