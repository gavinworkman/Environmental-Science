# 5.9 Impacts of Mining
**Mining**: obtaining minerals from the ground
- goal
- diamonds
- phosphorus bearing rock
- gravel
- coal

**Refining**: indsutrial process that removes impurities from substance

**Overburden**: when there is material above the ore you are mining

**Spoils**: the overburden once it is removed

**Strip mining**: Material harvested in strips

Mountaintop removal: You remove the mountaintop when trying to get the target mineral

Ore -> Target minerals (tailings are what is removed)

**Cyanide heap leaching**: Cynanide dissolves impurities and they go in a waste slury.

**Environmental consequences of mining**: 
- Soil erosion 
- desertification
- invasive species can take over
- lower albedo
- mining uses FFs
- Acid mine drainage: when compounds can react to form a highly acidic water which will go to nearby waterways and will dissolve what is in its way

**Remediation**: To fix the ecosystem to how it was before.
1. Re-establish vegetation:
	- grade land
	- enrich soil
	- plant vegetation in keeping with original habitat
	- monitor
2. Remediate acid mine drainage:
	- add a base
	- remove tailings
	- use bioremediation
