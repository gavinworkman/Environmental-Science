# 5.10 Impacts of Urbanization
**Urbanization**: People move from being spread apart (agriculture) to being concentrated in urban cities. 
- Pros
	- Mass transit
	- Everything is close to each other
	- Less need to travel
	- Efficient use of space
- Cons
	- Urbanization impacts the water cycle
	- Dams impact water bodies upstream and downstream
	- Saltwater intrusion into aquifers
	- Impermeable surfaces – water will runoff and aquifers will not get recharged
	- Impacts carbon cycle – burning of FFs & concentrated waste
	- Urban heat islands

**Urban sprawl**: Urban expansion into rural areas. Causes include transportation and quality of life.

**Remediation**: 
- Extend mass transit to suburban areas
- permeable pavement
- Urban planning – multi use buildings
