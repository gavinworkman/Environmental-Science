# 2.5 Natural Disruptions to Ecosystems

Type: Biodiversity

**Human disruption**: This is anthropogenic (i.e. logging forests causes habitat fragmentation)

**Natural disruption**: Not anthropogenic. Ex. Forest fire caused by lightning destroys habitat

Events can occur in a **periodic** (river overflowing seasonally), **episodic** (volcano eruption), and **random** (tornadoes) fashion.

**Migration**: Seasonal movement of animals, which usually involves moving from one habitat to another.

- Animals migrate primarily because of seasonal or geographic changes in resources/mating opportunities
- Fish and birds both migrate to areas with greater abundance of food
