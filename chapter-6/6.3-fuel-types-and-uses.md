# 6.3 Fuel Types and Uses

**Wood and charcoal**:

* used in developing countries
* removal of trees leads to soil erosion, which leads to further food security resources
* Deforestation can decrease amount of precipitation

**Peat**:

* partially decomposed organic material that can be burned for fuel
* using this indoors without proper ventilation can cause health problems

**Coal**:

* **Lignite**: Low heat capacity, low sulfur, high moisture
* **Bituminous**: most commonly used, high heating capacity, high sulfur
* **Anthracite**: Best quality, high heating capacity, low sulfur content
* Peat -&gt; Lignite -&gt; Bituminous -&gt; Anthracite \(caused by heat & pressure\)

**Natural gas**:

* cleanest fossil fuel because it doesnt release other harmful emissions
* still produces CO2, but doesnt produce other harmful pollutants
* it is mostly methane

**Tar sands**: combination of clay, sand, water, and bitumen. Not idea due to processing

**Refineries**: Take crude oil, and will extract certain different fuels in the rude oil through taking advantage of differing boiling points

**Cogeneration**: When fuel source is used to generate both useful heat and electricity.
