# 6.9 Hydroelectric Power

Kinetic energy of moving water -&gt; kinetic energy of spinning turbine -&gt; kinetic energy of spinning generator -&gt; electricity

**Micro hydro**: can be done on a riverway, a smaller scale operation

**Tidal power**: tides can turn a generator

* habitat destruction involved in creating reservoid
* can disrupt fish populations \(fish ladder is a solution\)

**Pros**:

* no air pollution
* no waste
* inexpensive once dam is built

**Cons**:

* flooding of land for reservoir
* disrupt river flow rates
* high maintenance cost for tidal
* lhigh construction cost for dams
* most viable sites already used
