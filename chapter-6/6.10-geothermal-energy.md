# 6.10 Geothermal Energy

**Geothermal Energy**: obtained using heat from Earth's interior

* water pumped down injection well
* stored heat from earths interior turns water to steam
* steam rises from the well
* steam turns turbine
* turns generator
* generates electricty

**Pros**:

* no combustion
* not dependent on weather

**Cons**:

* inaccessible
* release of gases when drilling \(hydrogen sulfide\)
* short term depletion of heat possible
* impact on groundwater
