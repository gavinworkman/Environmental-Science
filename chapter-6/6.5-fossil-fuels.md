# 6.5 Fossil Fuels

* combustion is a chemical process
* Fuel + O2 -&gt; CO2 + H2O
* Fuels can include:
  * Coal
  * Oil
  * NG

**Combustion**: 1. Pulverizing the coal 2. Burning/combustion 3. Burning heats water heating 4. Water converts to steam 5. Steam turns generator 6. This produces electricity

**Environmental problems**: 1. Mining – harms of extraction 2. Pulverized coal – small dust, flammable and harmful to repiratory systems 3. heavy use of water – needd for cooling 4. Carbon dioxide – contributes to climate change 5. Other pollutants – mercury and sulfur released

Extraction:

* NG extracted through hydraulic fracking
* Coal is extracted through mining – dug out of ground

**Surface mining**: removal of topsoi and habitat, overburden

**Subsurface mining**: destruction of habitat, dangerous

**Oil extraction**: habitat destruction, potential for spills

**Gas extraction**: destruction of habitat, water contamination, earthquakes

**Fracking**: 1. Make a well \(with clay lining to prevent groundwater leakage\) 2. Insert a pipe 3. Add fracking fluid 4. Gas will flow out

**Environmental problems**:

* well can contaminate water and destroy the habitat
* If pipe isnt properly lined, it will contaminate groundwater
* fracking fluid contains VOCs
* NG might leak out of the well
* May cause earthquakes – fracking breaks rock
