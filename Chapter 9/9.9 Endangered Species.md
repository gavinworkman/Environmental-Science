# 9.9 Endangered Species
 As habitats are lost or altered globally, many species are threatened with extinction.
 
 Factors that increase likelihood of extinction:
 - being extensively hunted
	 - Hunting can lead to loss of species
	 - **Poaching**: Illegal hunting, killing, or capturing animals for sale of profit.
	 - Aniamls hunted for:
		 - food
		 - prized body parts
		 - traditional medicinal uses
		 - medical research uses
		 - sport
 - having a limited diet
	 - niche specialists are at risk
	 - Traits like:
		 - specific habitat requirements
		 - limited diet
		 - low reproductive rates
		 - few offspring with high parental care
 - being outcompeted by invasive species
	 - Invasive species are usually r selected species
	 - they have high range of tolerance, helping them outcompete native species

**Adapt or perish**
- species must be able to adapt to changes in their environment to be able to survive
- adaptation requires genetic diversity
- migration is another solution rather than adaptation

**Selective pressure**: External factors that change behavior and fitness of organissms within an environment
- Examples:
	- food 
	- water
	- temperature
	- humdidity
	- pathogens
- These selective pressures determine which traits are beneficial

**Competition**:
- species seek to limit competition as its biologically costly
- Competition can become intense enough to lead to extinction if:
	- Trophic relationships are disrupted
	- increased competition
	- Scarce resources
- Under changing environmental conditions, generalist invasive species often outcompete native species

**Legislation** is one primary way to protect endangered species.
- criminalizing poaching
- prohibiting harming endangered species

Establishment of protected areas like wildlife refuses and national parks can also protect endagered species.
