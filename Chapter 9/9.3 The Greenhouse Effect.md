# 9.3 The Greenhouse Effect
The greenhouse effect occurs in the troposphere, not the stratosphere.

Greenhouse effect:
- Sunlight radiation will hit the earth
	- some will be absorbed
	- some is reradiated back as IR
- GHGs will absorb and reradiate the greenhouse gases back in all directions

Greenhouse effect helps keep the earth at a temperature that supports life.

**Greenhouse gases (GHGs)**:
- CO2
	- Mostly from transportation, electricity, and industry
- Methane
	- Comes from NG, digestion by animals (cows), landfills, etc.
- Water Vapor
	- Naturally occuring
	- It's residence time (time in atmosphere) is very low
- Nitrous oxide
	- From agriculture 
- CFCs
	- Coolants
- HFCs
	- Coolants
- Tropospheric Ozone
	- Secondary pollutant 

**Global warming potential (GWP)**:
- Carbon dioxide – 1
- Methane – 20
- Nitrous oxide – 300
- Ozone – 900 – 1000
- CFCs – 4600 – 10,000
- HFCs – 150-12,000

Even through CO2 has low GWP, it's concentration is high enough to make it account for most global warming.
