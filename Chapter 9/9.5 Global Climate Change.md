# 9.5 Global Climate Change

**Historical climate change**: 
- Ice cores can be used to get historical CO2 levels
- We can also pull data from volcanic ash
- historically CO2 levels and temperature are very correlated
- they took place gradually over long periods of time

Global warming right now is more rapid and we're exceeding previous maximum temperatures.

**Air circulation**: 
- Hadley cells can change in size
- Jet stream could change in strength
- This will significantly impact temperatures in areas

**Polar ice is melting**:
- ice has a high albedo 
- lot of IR reflected
- more IR will be absorbed
- this is a positive feedback loop – climate change results in more climate change

**Permafrost is melting**:
- solid layer of ice below the ground in the tundra, and its melting due to climate change
- leads to anaerobic decomposition which releases methane will leads to more climate change
- positive feedback loop

**Sea ice melting**: 
- Part of polar bears habitat
- They will wait for seals to come out for breath, and will then hunt them on top of sea ice
- Polar bears lose access to seals with ice melting

Sea level rise will make the photic zone higher – harms existing coral reefs.

Higher sea levels can move ecosystems out of the photic zone.

Ocean currents can change: 
- Connected by salinity and temperature
- If melted cold freshwater is coming down from Greenland and the Arctic, this can potentially shut this down
