# 9.10 Human Impacts on Biodiversity
**Factors that decrease biodiversity**:
**H** – Habitat destruction
**I** – Invasive species
**P** – Population growth (human)
**P** – Pollution
**C** – Climate Change
**O** – Over exploitation

**Habitat fragmentation**:
- large habitats are broken up into smaller isolated ones
- Causes:	
	- construction of roads/pipelines
	- clearing of land for agriculture and development
	- logging
- Not all species are equally impacted
- Generalists and species living in edge habitats thrive
- specialist species are usually adversely affected
- Negative impact on biodiversity overall
