# 9.10 Human Impacts on Biodiversity
**Factors that decrease biodiversity**:
**H** – Habitat destruction
**I** – Invasive species
**P** – Population growth (human)
**P** – Pollution
**C** – Climate Change
**O** – Over exploitation

**Habitat fragmentation**:
- large habitats are broken up into smaller isolated ones
- Causes:	
	- construction of roads/pipelines
	- clearing of land for agriculture and development
	- logging
- Not all species are equally impacted
- Generalists and species living in edge habitats thrive
- specialist species are usually adversely affected
- Negative impact on biodiversity overall

**Climate change**:
- plays role in habitat loss
	- Coastal inundation from melting land ice and permafrost
	- rising sea levels (thermal expansion)
	- Changes in precipiation patterns due to changing atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns

**Domestication**:
- involves artificial selection
- this reduces genetic diversity, as we're handpicking traits for us
- domestication for economic return lead to loss of biodiversity

**Mitigation strategies**:
- Creation of protected areas
- Habitat corridors (reduce effects of fragmentation)
- Restoration of lost habitats
- Sustainable land use practices
