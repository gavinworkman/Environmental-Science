# 1.9 Trophic Levels

Type: Ecosystems

**Trophic pyramid**: Producers → primary consumer → secondary consumer → tertiary consumers 

These all go bath to scavengers, decomposers, and detritivores, showing how energy is recycled in the system.

For each level in the trophic pyramid, energy is lost each step (due to respiration–heat, kinetic energy–movement, and body growth). This is because of the second law of thermodynamics

More producers = more productivity

The directions of the arrows in a good web show:

- the flow of energy through tropic levels
- flow of matter through trophic levels
