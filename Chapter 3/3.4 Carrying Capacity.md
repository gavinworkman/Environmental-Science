# 3.4 Carrying Capacity
**Carrying capacity**: maximum number of organisms the environmemt can support without degradation of resources (represented by letter k)

If a population exceeds carrying capacity, it will be an **overshoot**, followed by a **die-off**

Population dieback can be catastrophic – it can even lead to extinction or near extinction.

- r-selected species are the ones that often overshoot and dieback.
- k-selected species maintain their population at around carrying capacity

**Carrying capacity isn't constant** – depends on the abundance of resources
