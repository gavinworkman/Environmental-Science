# 1.2 Terrestrial Biomes

Type: Ecosystems

Organism → population → community → ecosystem → **biome**

\[\[biomes\]\] are characterized by **temperature**, **precipitation**, and **latitude**.

Hot humid regions have greater primary productivity and greater biodiversity than cold and dry regions

Biomes characterized by precipitation and temperature

**Altitude** also affects what biome is present

Example of how you can find multiple biomes in one state – all dependent on altitude

**Climatograms**: show precipitation and temperature of a location. They have two Y axes \(scales\)

* Identify growing season – where the temperature is over 0ºC
* If the line is flat, the temperature and precipitation is constant throughout the year
* They often have different scales – pay attention to the scale
* If temperature is over precipitation, it might be a desert

Environmental science also looks at humans interactions with ecosystems \(different than ecology\)

**\[\[Human impact\]\]**:

* Broadleaf temperate rainforest – logging and habitation
* Shrubland – habitation and favorable climate
* Temperate grasslands – agriculture
* Taiga – logging, tar sands, natural gas
* Tropical Rainforests – remain mostly intact. Timber, palm oil, grazing is there in some though.

Biomes change in location over time: Some animals will die out, other will migrate, and others adapt.
