# 8.4 Human Impact on Wetlands and Mangroves

**Wetlands**: Water coving soil or near the surface of soil for most of the year

Filtration – improves water waulity

* water moves slowly through wetlands, purifying the water

Wetlands hold water in place and release it slowly – like a sponge

Groundwater is recharched by wetlands

Wetlands are extremely productive ecosystems.

Provide services of fFiltering, flood control, and shoreline stablization.

Mangroves: Tidal wetlands

* productive
* Absorb bunch of CO2

Threats:

* development of commercial propeories
* filling in wetlands
* construction \(sedimentation\)
* dam construction
* Overfishing \(harm food web\)
* excess nutrients and pollutants from CAFOs – waste mismanaged
*
