# 8.5 Eutrophication

**Eutrophication**: When a waterway reciev4es excess nutrients

* sources
  * excess fertilizers
  * sewage from wastewater treatment
  * nitrogen from animal manure
  * phosphate from detergents
* **Eutrophic waterway**: high levels of algae due to excess nutrients
* **Oligotrophic**: low levels fo nutrients

Steps 1. Fertilizer enters system 2. Algae grow and reproduce 3. Algae die and microbes consume them, reducing DO levels 4. Other organisms die due to low DO levels, increasing levels of microbes

**Dead zones**: areas of low oxygen in oceans and lakes due ot nutrient pollution

Hypoxic waterways have low DO levels.
