# 8.2 Human Impacts on Ecosystems

Organisms have a range of tolerants for various pollutants.

Destructive fishing practices and sedimentation harms coral reefs.

**Optimal range of range of tolerance â€“** reproduction, growth, maintenance of homeostasis

**Physiological stress** occurs at higher and lower limits of the range of tolerance

**Oxygen sag curve**: DO levels vs. distance of point sources of polution

* Heavy metals in drinking can cause health issues to humans
* They can be released from FF burning
* Mercury causes neurological damagem and is biomagnified
* Plastic waste is a threat to wildlife, and can block the digestive system of marine organisms
