# APES Notes!

These are my notes from all the AP Classroom videos!

If there are any mistakes, feel free to edit this page at [https://github.com/pranavnt/APES](https://github.com/pranavnt/APES). Also, feel free to submit any edits which make it more thorough!

On another note, you should check out [Kobra](https://kobra.dev), a project I'm working on that you might find interesting :\)
