# 7.7 Acid Rain

- Natural rain has a pH of 5.6 
- acid rain has pH or 4.3
- Acidity is expressed using pH scale
- NOx reacts with water resulting in nitric acid
- SO2 reactions with water resulting in sulfuric acid
- Nitric acid and sulfuric acid can be in form of dry deposits or rain/snow

1. SOx and NOx are released
2. SOx and NOx react with water adn are carried by winds
3. Acid rain and dry particles are deposited
4. Ecosystems are negatively impacted because of this

Impact on forests and soils:
- Acid rain promots aluminum ions to leach from soils
- tree roots cannot take up calcium when aluminum ions are present
- reduced photosynthetic activity
