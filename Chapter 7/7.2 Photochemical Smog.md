# 7.2 Photochemical Smog

Fossil fuels -> NOx, VOCs

VOCs:
- they can vaporize at room temperature (volatile)
- example:
	- Anthropogenic:
		- Gormaldehyde
		- Gasoline
	- Natural sources
		- Trees
		- Many plant oils

Photochemical Smog
- Sources – urban areas with many cars
- Primary pollutants
	- NOx
	- VOCs
- Tropospheric conditions
	- sunlight
	- heat
- Secondary pollutants
	- Ozone
	- PANs

NO + VOC -> O3 + PANs

Factors influencing photochemical smog:
- timing:
	- NOx is produced early in day (morning rush hour)
	- Ozone concerntration peak in afternoon (icnrease sun intensity and temperatures)
- Location:
	- more ozone in warm climates and in summer

**Photochemical smog:
**- irritates eyes, nose, and throat
- long term exposure can cause lung cancer
- worsens existing heart/lung conditions

**Tropospheric ozone:**
- effects in humans
	- worsen bronchitis and emphysema
	- trigger asthma
	- cause permanent damage to lungs
- additionally environmental impacts of tropospheric ozone – enters plants through stomata and burns tissues, leads to leaf damage and less survival

Reduce nitrogen oxides: 
- catalytic converters
	- convert NO to O2 and N2
	- CO and hydrocarbons react to produce CO2 and H2O
	- Enforce emissions testing and standards for vehicles

Reduce VOCs:
- pump gas at night
- follow gasoline refueling instructions for effeicient vapor recovery, dont spill fuel, tighten gas cap securely

- improve fuel efficiency
	- tune engine
	- inflate tires
- Reduce use of internal combustion
	- make fewer trips, bike, or walk
	- use public transportation or carpool
	- dont idle
- reduce health imapcts
	- Minimize outdoor activity in late summer afternoons
	- wear a mask
