# 7.2 Photochemical Smog

Fossil fuels -> NOx, VOCs

VOCs:
- they can vaporize at room temperature (volatile)
- example:
	- Anthropogenic:
		- Gormaldehyde
		- Gasoline
	- Natural sources
		- Trees
		- Many plant oils

Photochemical Smog
- Sources â€“ urban areas with many cars
- Primary pollutants
	- NOx
	- VOCs
- Tropospheric conditions
	- sunlight
	- heat
- Secondary pollutants
	- Ozone
	- PANs

NO + VOC -> O3 + PANs

Factors influencing photochemical smog:
- timing:
	- NOx is produced early in day (morning rush hour)
	- Ozone concerntration peak in afternoon (icnrease sun intensity and temperatures)
- Location:
	- more ozone in warm climates and in summer
