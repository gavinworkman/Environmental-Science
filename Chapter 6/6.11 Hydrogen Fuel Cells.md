# 6.11 Hydrogen Fuel Cells

**Hydrogen Fuel Cells**:
- process like normal battery
- chemical reaction that occurs here is open – reactants can always be added
- Process:
	- H2 added to cell
	- in first reaction layer, hydrogen molecules are split into protons and electrons
	- protons move across the membrane, while electrons take another route
	- this creates a flow of electric current
	- O2 is taken in and split to combine with protons and electrons
	- Water vapor is the only emission

- we can get hydrogen from water through electrolysis – this requires electricity
- we can also get it from NG, by splitting methane, but this causes CO2 pollution

- We need to expend some energy to produce some energy – we want to minimize losses
- We cannot get 100% efficiency due to second law of thermodynamics

**Cons**:
- very expensive
- require raw materials
