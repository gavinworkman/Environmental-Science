# 6.7 Energy from Biomass

First law of thermodynamics: energy cannot be created or destroyed

Energy in biomass comes from the sun -> converted during photosynthesis

Biomass is the leading renewable energy source worldwide:
- direct source of heat in many developing nations
- also used for cooking
- Wood, peat, coal, etc.

**Pros**:
- accessible
- inexpensive
- used for heating and cooking

**Cons**:
- Air pollutants (CO2, Carbon monoxide, VOCs)
- Burned indoors (worse effects)
- Overharvesting of trees

**Biofuels**: liquid fuels from plant matter that can be used instead of conventional petroleum products

**Ethanol**: Made by fermenting starches into sugars and eventually alchohol (gas replacement)

**Biodiesel**: oils extracted from plants (diesel replacement)

**Pros**:
- Carbon neutral â€“ modern carbon
- Potentially renewable
- Produced domestically

**Cons**:
- net energy is low
- harvesting of crops has potential for:
	- increased use of FFs in harvest
	- deforestation
	- reduction in fertility of agricultural land

**Switchgrass**: potential alternative to ethanol

**Algae**: potential alternative to biodiesel
