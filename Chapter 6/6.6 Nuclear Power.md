# 6.6 Nuclear Power
**Fission**: Ore of U-235 used to generate electricity

**Steps**:
1. U-235 placed in fuel rods
2. it is stuck by outside neutron
3. process of splitting atom generates heat
4. Heat generates steam
5. steam turns a turbine
6. Steam cools and can be used again, heat is released

**Pros**: 
- no emissions
- high power output
- low cost
- no mining
- no air pollutants

**Cons**:
- hazardous waste
- thermal pollution
- high initial cost
- nonrewewable
- mining for uranium

Nuclear energy emits radioactive energy.

Spent U235 remains radioactive, and will radioactive for up to 24,000 years.

**Problems**:
- long lived storage
- happens on site, buried deeply
- NIMBY
- Many sites = more chances of radioactive waste leaking into environment

**Nuclear power accidents**:
**Three mile island**:
- started in non-nuclear portion of reaction
- water pump failed to allow water in
- reactor never cooled down
- fuel began to melt down partially
- no explosion or long term high radiation exposure
**Chernobyl**:
- power turned off during simulation
- extra power from turbnie was supposed to keep reacted powered so it can cool
- Control rods didnt drop after test
- Explosion occured, releasing most radiation ever from an accident
**Fukushima**:
- Tsunami occured in pacific
- 4 of the reactors were flooded
- all three melted down at the same time
- this is considered preventable

Half life: 
- measure of time for half of an atomic nucleus to decay
- decays into another atom, emitting radiation
- ten half lives generally means safety
-
