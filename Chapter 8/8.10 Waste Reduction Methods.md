# 8.10 Waste Reduction Methods
**Reduce > Reuse > Recycling**

Most of MSW can be recycled rather than going to a landfill.

Recycling can be costly – involves sorting, distribution, etc.

**Composting**: Collection of organic matter and then allowing it to decompose and form soil

**E-waste**: 
- Reuse 
- refurbish
- e-waste processing is not cheap to set up

Waste to energy – burn waste, creates steam which turns a turbine.

Methane recovery – collecting methane or flaring it

Cap landfill can be used for another purpose.
