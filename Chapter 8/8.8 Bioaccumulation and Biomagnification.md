# 8.8 Bioaccumulation and Biomagnification

**Bioaccumulation**: Seelctive absorption and concentration of fat soluble compounds in cells.
- nonpolar molecules will mix together (they are larger so they will not get excreted)
- DDT, PCBs, Methylmercury all bioaccumulate


**Biomagnification**: Compounds will magnify up the food chain
- smaller organisms at the bottom of the food chain will pass on the chemicals that are in their tissues when they're eaten
- it'll then bioaccumulate in the next organism all the way up to the food web
- apex predator has large concentration of that compound
- Examples:
	- Bald eagle is an apex predator
	- Bald eagles were harmed by DDT as a result of biomagnification (less calcium = thinner eggs)
	- Humans are an apex predator – affected by biomagnification
		- learning disabilities
		- birth defects
