# 2.6 Adaptations

Type: Biodiversity

**Adaptation:**

* Can be a **outward** change in appearance \(pepper moths\)
* Could be **biochemical**
  * Pesticide resistance
  * Individuals with pesticide resistance gene reproduce  and pass on that trait
  * Soon the population will be resistance

For a population to adapt to a new environment the advantageous gene must be present **before** environmental changes â€“ genetic diversity is really important

**Genetic diversity:**

* Raw material by which organisms adapt to the environment
* Is a result of random mutations that can advantage an individual if there are environmental changes
* Organisms adapt in both the short term and long term

Environmental changes force individuals to alter behavior, move, or perish.
